#Sorting

## Quick sort

Quicksort uses a pivot element to compare and swap elements to its right and left. Once the initial step is performed, using divide and concur, it does the above step over and over until everything is sorted.

Note that this is an **Unstable** sorting algorithm.

Quick sort is a **Comparison Sort**.
